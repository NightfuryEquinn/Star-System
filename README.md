# ME-Website-II
### 🔥 A major revamp and enhancement to ME-Website-I

<hr/>

After my 6-month internship, I decided to revamp and enhance my portfolio website. 
<br/>
It is legit a major change with libraries, framework and extra stuffs. 
<br/>
I even designed my own logo and created a wireframe in Figma. 
<br/>
It is still under development, but there are some information about my professional-side.

### 💡 Libraries and framework used: 
1️⃣ React Three Fiber
2️⃣ React Three Drei
3️⃣ Camera Controls
4️⃣ Three Custom Shader Material
5️⃣ GL-Noise
6️⃣ Vite & Vercel
7️⃣ TailwindCSS with Autoprefixer and PostCSS
8️⃣ Leva for Debugging

### 👻 Since it is a 3D portfolio, I personally created the model from Blender.
