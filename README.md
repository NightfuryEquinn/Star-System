### 🔥 A major revamp and enhancement to ME-Website-I

<hr/>

After my 6-month internship, I decided to revamp and enhance my portfolio website. 
<br/>
It is legit a major change with libraries, framework and extra stuffs. 
<br/>
I even designed my own logo and created a wireframe in Figma. 
<br/>
It is just a simple model showcase website but there are some information about my professional-side.

<hr/>

### 💡 Libraries and framework used: 
1. React Three Fiber <br/>
2. React Three Drei <br/>
3. Camera Controls <br/>
4. Three Custom Shader Material <br/>
5. GL-Noise <br/>
6. Vite & Vercel <br/>
7. TailwindCSS with Autoprefixer and PostCSS <br/>
8. Leva for Debugging <br/>

<hr/>

### 👻 Since it is a 3D portfolio, I personally created the model from Blender.
