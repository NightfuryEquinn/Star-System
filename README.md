# ME-Website-II
### 🔥 A major revamp and enhancement to ME-Website-I

<hr/>

After my 6-month internship, I decided to revamp and enhance my portfolio website. 
<br/>
It is legit a major change with libraries, framework and extra stuffs. 
<br/>
I even designed my own logo and created a wireframe in Figma. 
<br/>

### 💡 Libraries and framework used: 
1️⃣ React-Three-Fiber <br/>
2️⃣ React-Three-Drei <br/>
3️⃣ R3F-Perf <br/>
4️⃣ Leva <br/>
5️⃣ TailwindCSS <br/>
6️⃣ Vite <br/>
7️⃣ GlitchedWriter <br/>

<hr/>

### 👻 Since it is a 3D portfolio, I also used some resources from:
1️⃣ Poly Haven <br/>
2️⃣ Solar Textures <br/>
3️⃣ Textures For Planets

P/S: 🤡 If I missed any credits, please do not hestitate to tell me to include it.
